It contains my independent work during "3+1+1" program in NUS(Chongqing).
In Epymarl contains my trials and results using SUMO an MARL.
The 4200 project provided my answer to the EEC4200 course completion practice.
FYP encompasses the results of my efforts during the CA1 stage. I have constructed a brand-new network architecture of dtqn+transformer and rnn+transformer. 
In epymarl, I mainly recorded my practice in SUMO and an independently completed multi-agent game environment based on SUMO
The SUMO-based environment is in envs/ev_envfmp.py.
test_wrapper.py is a wrapper to satisfy the requirements of multi-agent environment.
The transformer+rnn architecture is in modules/mixers/tmix3.py
Customized map is in dataset.
If you want to test it, please run command:
python src/main.py --config=tmix3 --env-config=gymma with env_args.time_limit=200 env_args.key="test-parallel-v6"
仅以此，记录我的青春、我的汗水以及我的梦想。
